# 🧠 IRIS Protocol

**AI-Powered Risk Engine for Solana DeFi**  
Detect wallet risk in real time. Protect assets autonomously. Build with confidence.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**IRIS** is a decentralized, non-custodial AI protocol designed to assess portfolio risk, score tokens and wallets, and automatically protect digital assets using real-time on-chain signals. Built on the Solana blockchain, IRIS gives DeFi users peace of mind through:

- Dynamic **risk scoring**
- **Auto-swap** actions to reduce exposure
- **Insurance NFTs** for on-chain coverage
- Open **SDK & API** for integrations
- Full **wallet ownership and privacy**

---

## 🔐 Why IRIS?

DeFi is volatile. Rugpulls, flash crashes, whale dumps, and liquidity drains happen every day.

**IRIS gives you:**

- 🧠 Smart AI models that assess risk across your wallet and assets
- 🔄 Auto-protective actions (like swaps or alerts) based on thresholds *you* control
- 🛡️ Claimable Insurance NFTs to cover losses for approved events
- ⚙️ Developer tools to embed risk-scoring into dApps and wallets

- **Insurance NFTs**: Tiered coverage with on-chain, transparent claims.
- **Non-Custodial**: You retain full wallet control. No key access or off-chain tracking.
